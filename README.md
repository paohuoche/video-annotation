# About this project

The project is only a prototype of video annotation, which is used to demonstrate how the user experience of annotating on video. And I have used it on our own business project.

I create it with the help of my other [library](https://github.com/paohuoche/react-drawing-library). Here, I remove some unnecessary little features and interact with the backend.

Hope it can give you guys a little inspiration.
